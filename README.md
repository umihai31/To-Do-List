# To Do List APP

After having a chat with Copilot (AI), i've asked him to make me a python quizz, after the quizz, i've made a request to make me a task so i can learn python from tasks. 
AI was not used in help of this project only after the project was done to check if all requirements were fully covered and if anything is ok

To Do's :
  - Project can be improved by using error handler (ranges, invalid values and so on)
  - It can be added, a GUI - not a priority because it's hard to do it on google colab.
  - All the information can be added to a file , so, that working with files can be learned.
